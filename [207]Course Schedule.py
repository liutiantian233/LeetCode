# There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to 
# numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai,
#  bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
#  
# 
#  
#  For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to 
# first take course 1. 
#  
# 
#  Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you 
# should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= numCourses <= 10⁵ 
#  0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000 
#  prerequisites[i].length == 2 
#  0 <= ai, bi < numCourses 
#  All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
